# spoyler
Open source clone of the Spotify desktop UI framework in same languages and libraries as Spotify was prior to 0.8.3 without any CEF integration, and will do two branches of it - one as an Spotify desktop client clone, and another for other projects, where I rewrite the good ui tech Spotify had before they messed it up completely with CEF.
The graphics is taken from the client theme but can be easily changed.
